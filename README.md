# Machine-Learning-to-extract-intrinsic-parameters-for-a-PIC-platform-

This repository contains the code used to infer intrinsic physical parameters
(onsite losses and resonant frequency shifts) of coupled ring-resonator
photonic integrated circuits (PICs) from spectral measurements using
supervised machine learning.

The code accompanies a research manuscript and is organized by physical
“cases” (A, B, C), corresponding to increasing model complexity.
